/// Represent a "ring" of addresses in the spiral memory grid.
///
/// ## Part 1
///
/// The first step to solving the puzzle is to find the "ring" in the spiral memory grid in which
/// the target address can be found.
///
/// This is the layout of the grid in question:
///
/// 17  16  15  14  13
/// 18   5   4   3  12
/// 19   6   1   2  11
/// 20   7   8   9  10
/// 21  22  23  24  25 ...
///
/// Notice that if you start at address 1 and move down & right, then down & right again, each
/// of these "corner" addresses is a perfect square.
///
/// For every odd n, we can generate the range of addresses in the ring as follows:
///
/// ring start: n^2 + 1
/// ring end: (n + 2)^2
///
/// This yields:
///
/// Ring 1: (2, 9)
/// Ring 2: (5, 16) --> this is NOT a valid ring
/// Ring 3: (10, 25) --> this IS a valid ring
/// Ring 4: invalid
/// Ring 5: (26, 49)
/// ...
///
/// With this in mind, we can quickly narrow in on the ring that contains the target address.
///
/// For example, `sqrt(12) â‰ˆ 3.46`, rounded down is 3; hence 12 should be found on Ring 3 (10, 25).
///
/// Then, once we know the ring that contains the given address, it's easy to determine the
/// distance to the origin. There are exactly three options for each address in a ring:
/// 1. The address is a corner, so the distance is `n + 1`.
/// 2. The address is along an axis to the origin (e.g., 2, 11, 28), so the distance is `n - 2`.
/// 3. The address is between a corner and an axis, so the distance is equal to `n + 1 - d` where
///    `d` is the difference between the address and the closest corner.
///
/// In practice, options 2 and 3 are identical because when the address is on an axis with the
/// origin, `n + 1 - d = n - 2`.
///
/// ## Part 2
///
/// Unfortunately, part 2 requires we easily compute adjacent addresses in the grid which this
/// approach is well suited for. See: [`Addr`].
